Includes jQuery, Twitter Bootstrap, and a JavaScript Date Formatter - License all inside

How do I use it?
Go to Google Developer API console (https://code.google.com/apis/console/) and create a project, or use existing one, that has the Google+ Service turned on. You will need an API Key to get "About" and "Photo" sections to work.

Open /js/gdg.js and modify the config lines 3-5, with your GDG Name, Google+ Profile ID (Use your chapters +Page, not your personal), and API Key

Should just work ...
